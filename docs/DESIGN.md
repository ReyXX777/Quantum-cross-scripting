# Quantum Cross-Scripting Design Document

## Introduction

The **Quantum Cross-Scripting** project aims to detect and prevent **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks in real-time using advanced machine learning algorithms. The system is designed to analyze user inputs, detect potential vulnerabilities, and prevent malicious activities by leveraging AI-powered techniques.

This design document provides an overview of the architecture, components, data flow, and key design decisions for the Quantum Cross-Scripting system.

## System Overview

The Quantum Cross-Scripting system consists of several key components:

1. **Frontend**: Provides the user interface for interacting with the system, including input submission and results display.
2. **Backend API**: Handles incoming requests from the frontend, processes them, and communicates with the machine learning model for XSS detection.
3. **Machine Learning Model**: An AI-powered model that analyzes input data to detect potential XSS attacks.
4. **Database**: Stores information such as detection logs, user data, and configuration settings.
5. **Logging and Monitoring**: Tracks detection results and stores logs for audit and review purposes.

The system architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, with components communicating via RESTful APIs.

### Key Components

1. **Frontend**: 
   - Built using **Blazor**, a modern framework for building interactive web UIs using C#. 
   - The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP requests.
   - Displays results from the XSS detection and shows logs.

2. **Backend API**:
   - Built with **ASP.NET Core** to handle HTTP requests and interact with the database and machine learning model.
   - Exposes RESTful endpoints to interact with the frontend and manage user data, logs, and settings.

3. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - The XSS detection model is built using **TensorFlow.NET** for real-time analysis of input data.
   - The model analyzes the input text for potential XSS patterns and classifies it as safe or malicious.

4. **Database**:
   - Uses **SQL Server** to store critical data such as user profiles, logs, and configuration settings.
   - The database supports transactional queries and stores logs of detected XSS vulnerabilities.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Uses **Serilog** for logging errors, information, and other system activities.
   - Integrates with **Prometheus** for real-time monitoring of system health and metrics.

## Data Flow

The system follows a straightforward flow of data between the user, frontend, backend, machine learning model, and the database.

### 1. **User Input**:
   - The user submits input through the **Blazor frontend** (e.g., form submissions, text input).
   - The frontend sends the input to the **Backend API** using an HTTP POST request to the `/api/detect` endpoint.

### 2. **Backend Processing**:
   - The **Backend API** receives the input and sends it to the **Machine Learning Model** for XSS detection.
   - The model processes the input, and the backend returns a response indicating whether the input is safe or contains potential XSS threats.

### 3. **Logging**:
   - The system logs all interactions with **Serilog**, including detection results and any errors.
   - Logs are stored in a central location for audit purposes and are accessible via the **Backend API**.

### 4. **Database Interaction**:
   - The **Backend API** interacts with the **SQL Server database** to store and retrieve data, including user profiles, logs, and configuration settings.

### 5. **Displaying Results**:
   - The **Frontend** receives the result from the **Backend API** and displays it to the user, providing insights on the safety of the input.

## Database Design

The database schema is designed to support user management, detection logs, and configuration settings.

### Tables

1. **Users**:
   - Stores information about the users interacting with the system.
   - Fields: `Id`, `Username`, `Email`, `Password`, `CreatedAt`, `Role`.

2. **Logs**:
   - Stores logs of detected XSS vulnerabilities and other system activities.
   - Fields: `Id`, `Message`, `LogLevel`, `Source`, `User`, `Timestamp`.

3. **Settings**:
   - Stores configuration settings for the application.
   - Fields: `Id`, `Key`, `Value`.

### Example Log Entry

| Id  | Message                                      | LogLevel | Source           | User    | Timestamp           |

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Sanitization**:
   - All user inputs are validated and sanitized before being processed by the machine learning model to avoid accidental malicious injections.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Users must authenticate using secure login mechanisms.
   - The system implements role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive information.

3. **Encryption**:
   - Sensitive data, such as passwords, are stored securely using encryption and hashing algorithms.

4. **XSS Attack Prevention**:
   - The entire system is built to prevent XSS attacks by design. The machine learning model is specifically trained to detect XSS patterns in input.

## Design Decisions

1. **Technology Stack**:
   - **Frontend**: Blazor for building modern web UIs.
   - **Backend**: ASP.NET Core for its high performance, security features, and support for RESTful APIs.
   - **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.NET to leverage the power of TensorFlow for detecting XSS attacks.
   - **Database**: SQL Server for reliable and scalable data storage.
   - **Logging**: Serilog for flexible and structured logging, with Prometheus for monitoring.

2. **AI Model**:
   - The machine learning model is built to analyze patterns of malicious input, leveraging techniques such as supervised learning for classification.
   - The model is retrained periodically to adapt to evolving XSS attack patterns.

## Future Considerations

- **Scalability**: The system is designed to be scalable, allowing for the addition of more detection models or the integration of additional machine learning algorithms.
- **User Interface Improvements**: Future iterations will enhance the UI to provide more detailed reports and user-friendly dashboards for log analysis and monitoring.
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuous improvements to reduce latency in detecting XSS attacks in real-time.

## Conclusion

The **Quantum Cross-Scripting** project is designed with scalability, performance, and security in mind. By utilizing machine learning and AI-driven techniques, the system provides real-time XSS detection, prevention, and logging, making it a valuable tool for web security. This design document outlines the architecture and key components of the system, ensuring that the implementation is well-understood and can evolve as the project grows.
