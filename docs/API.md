# Quantum Cross-Scripting API Documentation

Welcome to the official API documentation for the **Quantum Cross-Scripting** project. This API is designed to detect and prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks in real-time using AI-powered algorithms.

## Base URL

The base URL for the API is:

https://api.quantum-cross-scripting.com

Copy code

All API endpoints are relative to this URL.

## Authentication

The API uses **Bearer Token Authentication**. To access protected endpoints, you must include a valid token in the `Authorization` header of your request.

### Example Header:

## Endpoints

### 1. **Detect XSS Vulnerability**

Detect whether a given input text is vulnerable to XSS attacks.

- **URL**: `/api/detect`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**:
  - `inputText` (string, required): The text to analyze for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

#### Request Example:

```json
{
  "inputText": "<script>alert('XSS');</script>"
}
Response:
200 OK: Successfully processed the request.
Body: The result indicating if the input contains malicious content (XSS).
json
Copy code
{
  "isMalicious": true
}
400 Bad Request: If the input is invalid or missing.
Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "error": "Input text is required."
}
2. Get Analysis Report
Get a detailed report of detected XSS vulnerabilities.

URL: /api/report/{reportId}
Method: GET
URL Parameters:
reportId (string, required): The unique ID of the XSS detection report.
Request Example:
bash
Copy code
GET /api/report/12345
Response:
200 OK: Successfully retrieved the report.
Body: A detailed report of the XSS detection.
json
Copy code
{
  "reportId": "12345",
  "inputText": "<script>alert('XSS');</script>",
  "detectionResult": {
    "isMalicious": true,
    "vulnerabilityType": "Stored XSS",
    "severity": "High"
  },
  "createdAt": "2024-12-30T14:00:00Z"
}
404 Not Found: If the report is not found.
Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "error": "Report not found."
}
3. Create New Log Entry
Create a new log entry for tracking detected XSS vulnerabilities.

URL: /api/logs
Method: POST
Request Body:
message (string, required): Description of the detected vulnerability.
logLevel (string, optional): The severity level of the log (e.g., "Info", "Error").
source (string, optional): The source of the log (e.g., "DetectionService").
user (string, optional): The user associated with the log entry (if applicable).
Request Example:
json
Copy code
{
  "message": "XSS detected in input text.",
  "logLevel": "Error",
  "source": "XssDetectionService",
  "user": "admin"
}
Response:
201 Created: Successfully created a log entry.
Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "id": 123,
  "message": "XSS detected in input text.",
  "logLevel": "Error",
  "source": "XssDetectionService",
  "user": "admin",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-30T14:00:00Z"
}
400 Bad Request: If the request body is invalid.
Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "error": "Invalid log data."
}
Error Handling
The API uses standard HTTP status codes for error handling. Common errors include:

400 Bad Request: The request is malformed or contains invalid data.
404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found.
500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server.
Example Error Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "error": "Invalid input text format."
}
Rate Limiting
To ensure fair use of the API, rate limiting is enforced. You can make up to 100 requests per minute.

429 Too Many Requests: If the rate limit is exceeded.
json
Copy code
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
}
Change Log
