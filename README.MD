AI-XSS Prevention Project

Overview
The AI-XSS Prevention Project aims to enhance web security by detecting and preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks in real-time. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, the system helps safeguard user data and ensure secure web interactions.

Features
- Real-time XSS detection and prevention
- High accuracy with minimal false positives and negatives
- Scalable to handle large volumes of web traffic
- User-friendly interface for monitoring and managing XSS detection activities

Tech Stack
- Front-End: Blazor
- Back-End: ASP.NET Core
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow.NET
- Database: PostgreSQL or SQL Server
- DevOps: Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform
- Monitoring: Serilog, Prometheus, and Grafana
- Authentication: IdentityServer4 or ASP.NET Core Identity
